This journey shows my path in learning about this valuable tool. For starters, in Bush's article, we learn about the begining of the memex, and how he intorduced the idea of storing valuable information in a manner that makes sense. What I mean by that is that Bush envisoned storing our information in an innovative way, not just by date or by subject. But by connecting ideas in a meaningful way that allows for our ideas to grow to their highest potential. This article opened my eyes and showed me just how important the memex could be, at an research level for professionals but also for students looking to organize notes.</p> <p>My next step in my journey is an idea from my thoughts folder that connects to Bush, Caulfied and Kumar's articles. This idea is short and simple but asks an important question. Why did it take so long? what stopped scientists, researchers and others from developping this idea, why did we wait to organize our ideas meaningfully. Like I said in the note, the digitilization of files certainly helped us in achieving this, however, begs the question if anyone tried to implement this idea without the use of technology.</p> <p>The third step in my journey is from Caulfield's article, in this article Caulfield talks about his federated wiki. His federated wiki is a place for him to post his thoughts on different things he sees. He often compares it to his twitter but in a more refined and well thought out way. The federated wiki stores all of his thoughts and he can them organize them in a way he finds valuable. To me this sounded eerily similar to a memex, which Caulfield talks about and gives credit to Bush. This article is important because it grows the idea of the memex, it expands on what you can do with a memex, what you can use your memex for. </p> <p>The next step in my journey is from a January 11th lecture where I took note of Bush's memex. Specifically, \" The way we record info matters\". This sentence really stuck with me and had a large impact on my thinking. I think it's because its simple but concise on what it's trying to convey. It's saying that we can take all the notes we want, but at the end of the day if we don't have much care as to how were using these notes, they become invaluable. For me, I've taken notes throughout my academic career, however rarely use them, because I had never learned how to record it with purpose. I never learned about connecting ideas or anything like that, and my notes would then become unused and useless. Understanding the importance of a memex is crucial, and has really helped me make my notes useful and of purpose.</p> <p>The final step in my journey was Kumar's article, in this article, Kumar talks about how the way we stored books and other pieces in library progressed over time. Once again, its the same idea as Bush and Caulfield, the importance of organizing our information so that it is most helpful to us. In this article it's kind of insane to see just how unorganized we were and how much it hampered our ability to learn. </p> <p>My journey from Bush to Kumar demonstrates my learning about what I think has stuck with me most, which is the memex and how much power it has for you if you operate it properly. The idea of the memex is incredibly valuable to me and will be a tool I will be using going forward in my studies. </p>"},{"location":"Journey%20Assignement/0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":""},{"location":"Journey%20Assignement/0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between","title":"The Journey Between","text":""},{"location":"Journey%20Assignement/0_Final%20Journey_2/#wwimilitarycommunication-and","title":"@WWIMilitaryCommunication and","text":""},{"location":"Journey%20Assignement/0_Final%20Journey_2/#withingtonthomassatcom","title":"@WithingtonThomasSatcom","text":"<ul> <li>@WWIMilitaryCommunication</li> <li>Telephones in WWI</li> <li>@BritanicaWWIIMilitaryCommunication</li> <li>Mobile radios WWII</li> <li>@TarantolaAndrewColdWarRadioRooms2014MM3</li> <li>@WithingtonThomasSATCOM MM3</li> </ul> <p>For the second question of this assignement, my memory from the tutorial level is not very strong. However, after the first few weeks of this course and after understanding the direction of the course, I knew I really wanted to research how the military was affected by the advancement of communication and technology as a whole. While I don't consider myself a strong supporter of the military as a whole, the world wars have always been incredibly interesting to me. My grade 10 history class was one of my favourite classes ever and I knew we had only really scratched the surface on the history of the war. So with the memex assignements I had an excuse to look deeper into the history. So one of the things I knew I wanted to get out of the course was to learn more about the communcations of the military during the wars when technology was not nearly as advanced as it is today.</p> <p>In the first article I learned about the communication used in WWI, which was very basic and used limited technology. They used telephones primarily but these phones needed telephone lines to be placed which was often at risk of being damaged due to the ongoing war. Which made communication sketchy at times. The telegraph was also very popular and used frequently in the war aswell as radios. However the radios had skeptics due to them being interceptable.</p> <p>The next note briefly talks about the telephones used in WWI.</p> <p>The next note is a source note that talks about the communications used in WWI. This was where I was really interested, to see how far we had come in give or take 20 years. To see how quickly we were able to evolve our communication and technology. However the answer was far less exciting, the technology used was not that far off what was used in WWI atleast from a machine standpoint. The reliability and functionality of the devices improved vastly, specifically the radios, which were now much more mobile and became standard issue for soldiers.</p> <p>The next note is an atomic note asking about the mobile radios and if they were easy for the soldiers to understand and use. </p> <p>We then advance to the cold war, where radios conitntue to evolve and we see the introduction of the radio rooms, where secret messages are played 24/7 to be encoded by the intended recipient. </p> <p>Finally we get to modern day tech with SATCOM, technology that is more commonly known as radars. These radars are incredbily valuable to the military for its reliability and ability to travel long distances. The radars are primarily used to communicate with forces that may be extremly far away from headquarters, but thanks to SATCOM they can communicate and relay important information.</p> <p>Overall, I would say I did accomplish my goal, in the early stages of the course I wanted to get a better understanding as to how the military communicated with eachother before all of the tools we have at our disposal came to fruition. And that I did, I learned about the communications used in WWI,WWII and the coldwar. I also thouroughly enjoyed doing so, I stated before the world wars have always been super interesting to me but we never covered the communcations much. To learn about telegrams, radios and telephones used in the war was really cool and I'm glad I got to do so. </p>"},{"location":"Sources/%40BritanicaWWIIMilitaryCommunication/","title":"@BritanicaWWIIMilitaryCommunication","text":""},{"location":"Sources/%40BritanicaWWIIMilitaryCommunication/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<p>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc.
