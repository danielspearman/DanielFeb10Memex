### Summary and Key Thoughts
This article talks about the technology developped during the cold war and it's place in todays world. The most significant being ARPANET and the GPS system. The artcile also talks about a what if scenario if there were to be another arms race.



### Annotations


“If you are reading this, you’re already using a technology developed for cold warriors; _The Internet_.”

-   Learned about this from a previous article [[@ColdWarTechnologicalAdvancesMM3]]
-

“Minuteman was the first mass implementation of a general purpose digital computer; it integrated an autopilot and missile guidance system in one package, with reliable storage that could take the stress of a silo launch. The computer was also capable of storing multiple targets, and was reprogrammable.”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Kind of unclear, does this have any significance in our everyday lives?

“Transistors were nothing new at that point; they were developed years before by Bell Labs.”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Not too sure what this is, I’ll look into it

“This Cold War relic has been in service since the Kennedy administration, and the current incarnation has been around for 45 years, receiving multiple hardware and software updates over the years.”

-   Maybe I’m missing something, but why?

“I am not disputing the brilliance of people like Intel co-founders Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore. I have no doubt they would have made their mark on the tech industry even without the biggest arms race in history”

[[2023-04-03]

-   Cool to see how much more funding the scientists at the time got.

“They made energy grids and transportation infrastructure more efficient”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Would like to learn more about this and what exactly became more efficient

“helped improve safety in industrial facilities, including sensitive chemical and nuclear facilities”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Is this because we learned more about nuclear power and the importance of safety?

“_They’re all better thanks to the biggest waste of money in history._ Granted, we all have trace amounts of Strontium 90 in our bones, but in the big scheme of things, it’s a small price to pay for the high-tech world we enjoy so much.”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Really makes you wonder if we’d be where we are without the cold war

“Video games were pioneered on the earliest digital computers (and some analogue ones as well). In fact, _Tennis for Two_, arguably the first game to use a graphical display, was developed for an analogue computer in 1958.”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Kind of crazy to see everything we got out of the cold war
