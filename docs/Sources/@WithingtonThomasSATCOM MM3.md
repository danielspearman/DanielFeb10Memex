### Summary and Key Thoughts
In this article, Withington looks into the SATCOM technology used by all branches of the US military. To start, he talks about SATCOM without the satelites in space and all the issues there would be. We soon learn about the importnace of the sattelite and why it is needed. After, we see the military applications that SATCOM has and why it is a crucial tool for the military.


### Annotations


“All branches of the military rely on Satellite Communications (SATCOM). SATCOM is used by sea, land, air and space forces because of its ability to traverse long distances or bypass obstructions.”

-   I wonder when SATCOM was first introduced, and how long it took for it to be used by every branch

“ In practice the antenna of the transmitting radio must have an unobscured ‘view’ towards the receiving radio”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Could this not prove to cause problems, especially during war times?

“ A radio with an antenna two metres (six feet) above the ground can send and receive transmissions across a range of circa six kilometres/km (four miles). The higher the antenna, the longer the range. An antenna atop a 300-feet (91-metre) hill will have a range of circa 40km (24 miles).”

-   This does not seem proportionate at all

“Other hills may block the transmission if the receiving radio is in a valley. In urban areas, buildings and objects can block a radio’s line of sight. Trees in a forest can have a similar effect. This does not necessarily mean the radio traffic will not reach its destination.”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Again, this seems like it could be very troublesome

“SATCOM ‘outflanks’ these obstructions by beaming radio traffic into space where it is received by a satellite.”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   Kind of assumed there had to be another layer to SATCOM

“Thus, SATCOM has two uses: It helps avoid obstacles impeding relatively short-range radio traffic. It also allows two radios to communicate over intercontinental distances by avoiding the curvature of the Earth: A radio in New York would need an antenna at 2.6 million feet altitude (800,000m) to reach a radio 5,570km (3,461 miles) away in London. A satellite in space thus acts as the radio’s antenna to achieve this intercontinental range.”

-   This is super interesting, cool to see how tall the tower would need to be without SATCOM

“ The team uses Mil SATCOM to communicate with their headquarters thousands of kilometers away in their home country. Similarly, two military vehicles may be separated from each other by a mountain range impeding their LOS V/UHF radios. SATCOM will let these vehicles bypass the mountain range by bouncing their communications traffic across a satellite.”

-   This is why I wanted to look into the military side of this course, real life and pressing scenarios where technology is crucial

“For example, deployed special forces troops maybe operating hundreds of miles from their headquarters in a spartan environment.”

[[2023-04-03]]

-   I assume other militarys have similar systems
