### Summary and Key thoughts
Reading the title of the article I expceted more of an article discussing what an arms race would look like today. Instead, the artcile goes indepth on the arms race of the cold war and the policies behind it. The article was not really what I was looking for, but still an interesting read.


### Annotations

“After all, the same nations pronouncing such benevolent goals continue to fund and build a new generation of [destabilizing weapons](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/06/politics/air-force-hypersonic-missile-test/index.html)”

[[2023-04-05]]

-   What exactly is a destabilizing weapon?

“he United States, for example, plans to spend $400 billion over the next decade and $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years to modernize its nuclear arsenal.”

[[2023-04-05]]

-   Pretty absurd numbers to think about

“ Though important transnational organizations such as the International Campaign for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons ([ICAN](https://www.icanw.org/)) have succeeded in making [nuclear weapons illegal](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/01/un-nuclear-powers-must-sign-historic-treaty-making-nuclear-weapons-illegal/), no nation in possession of these weapons has supported disarmament.”

-   How much does that actually do? if countries still posses them and develop them

“As tensions with Russia rise, [strategically obsolete](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/icbms-are-obsolete-and-dangerous-and-should-be-eliminated-170666) intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remain on hair-trigger alert, creating the potential for [accidental nuclear war](https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/nuclear-close-calls-able-archer-83).”

[[2023-04-05]]

-   What exactly is accidental nuclear war?

“Yet loopholes in these treaties allowed the arms race not just to continue, but to flourish, while surrounding arms control in a haze of acronyms and [technical jargon](https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/15/world/what-is-throw-weight.html).”

[[2023-04-05]]

-   What exactly were these loopholes

“In June 1982, over [1 million people took to the streets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkOm_fvl68w) of New York City to rally against the arms race”

[[2023-04-05]]

-   I’d imagine even more people would protest it today

“In Congress, Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Rep. James McGovern (D-Mass.) have introduced [the Hastening Arms Limitation Talks (HALT) Act](https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-and-rep-mcgovern-lead-expansive-legislation-to-halt-dangerous-21st-century-nuclear-arms-race)_,_ with the goal of a freeze on the further global deployment of nuclear weapons.”

-   What are the odds Russia would follow this?

“Indeed, as the history of the grass-roots anti-nuclear activism shows, even when Armageddon appears at the doorstep, it is still possible to pressure even the most hard-line governments to turn back the Doomsday Clock.”

[[2023-04-05]]

-   I feel like there is a even larger population of activism in todays day and age
