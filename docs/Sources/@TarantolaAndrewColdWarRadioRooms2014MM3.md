### Summary
In this article, we look into the Cold War radio rooms and their purpose. We get to know where they originated from (sorta) and how they were used to communicate and how the receiver translated the message. We also learned of the security of them and why they are still used to this day.


### Annotations

“In the early days of espionage, long before the advent of burner phones, satcoms, and other modern-day spy gadgets, getting word to field agents”

-   I always wonder how many spies are in Canada at any given time and what are they investigating

“especially those working behind the Iron Curtain—proved a dangerous game with global consequences should the agent's cover be blown.” [[2023-03-13]]

-   Need to look into what the iron curtain was #todo

“A number station is one of many short-wave radio stations broadcasting a seemingly endless series of encoded messages throughout the world.”

-   So how does the receiver know when something is of importance

‘To the untrained observer, these broadcasts sound like gibberish. They're typically recordings of a synthesized female voice (they're almost never real humans) reading strings of alphanumeric characters, often in a variety of languages including Spanish, German, English, Russian, and Chinese—or just straight morse code.”

-   I feel like I’ve heard audio of these before

“These stations first came to the public's attention in the 1960s, when a Time magazine article revealed that they had been in use since the end of WWII, however additional research by The Conet Project suggests that they might have been put in place as far back as WWI.”

-   Kinda cool the origin date is kind of murky and not concrete, is there any way to know who started them?

“In fact, no government in the world has ever even confirmed that these stations exist, much less what they're used for.”

[[2023-03-13]]

-   I guess this would answer my last question

“The number station system is, when used correctly, is virtually impossible to detect and essentially foolproof”

[[2023-03-13]]

-   Except in Stranger Things where teenagers working at an ice cream shop do it

“All the agent requires is a commercially-available shortwave radio and a [one-time pad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) to decipher the message.”

[[2023-03-13]]

-   I assume a one-time pad is how they translate the message.

“So long as they're not under electronic surveillance or have the one-time pad discovered, there's effectively zero chance of having the message intercepted and decrypted.”

[[2023-03-13]]

-   So only if the spy was caught, these messages could not be encrypted

“And even with the advent of modern, heavily-encrypted communications systems, number stations remain a viable means of issuing directives to covert agents. "Nobody has found a more convenient and expedient way of communicating with an agent”,”

[[2023-03-13]]

-   I think it’s really cool that this is still considered the best way to do it
