“As part of the multitude of spy devices created for espionage purposes during the Cold War, the development of tiny portable and hidden video and recording technologies emerged.”

-   This is suprising that tiny cameras popped up then, can’t imagine the image quality was very good

“as the events in the Chrenobyl meltdown demonstrate, nuclear power also can have a devastating effect on human life and the surrounding ecosystem if anything goes wrong.”

-   Was the Chernobyl plant built because of the Cold War?

“  
Yes, even the glorious Internet emerged from military technology. ARPANET, the precursor to the Internet, was developed by the American military as a network of communication across the country on servers that were decentralized, as a way to safeguard against the possibility of a nuclear attack”

-   Was this very secure? was it kept under wraps and only those in the military aware of it?
