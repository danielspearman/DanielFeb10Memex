For the second question of this assignement, my memory from the tutorial level is not very strong. However, after the first few weeks of this course and after understanding the direction of the course, I knew I really wanted to research how the military was affected by the advancement of communication and technology as a whole. While I don't consider myself a strong supporter of the military as a whole, the world wars have always been incredibly interesting to me. My grade 10 history class was one of my favourite classes ever and I knew we had only really scratched the surface on the history of the war. So with the memex assignements I had an excuse to look deeper into the history. So one of the things I knew I wanted to get out of the course was to learn more about the communcations of the military during the wars when technology was not nearly as advanced as it is today.

In the first article I learned about the communication used in WWI, which was very basic and used limited technology. They used telephones primarily but these phones needed telephone lines to be placed which was often at risk of being damaged due to the ongoing war. Which made communication sketchy at times. The telegraph was also very popular and used frequently in the war aswell as radios. However the radios had skeptics due to them being interceptable.

The next note briefly talks about the telephones used in WWI.

The next note is a source note that talks about the communications used in WWI. This was where I was really interested, to see how far we had come in give or take 20 years. To see how quickly we were able to evolve our communication and technology. However the answer was far less exciting, the technology used was not that far off what was used in WWI atleast from a machine standpoint. The reliability and functionality of the devices improved vastly, specifically the radios, which were now much more mobile and became standard issue for soldiers.

The next note is an atomic note asking about the mobile radios and if they were easy for the soldiers to understand and use. 

We then advance to the cold war, where radios conitntue to evolve and we see the introduction of the radio rooms, where secret messages are played 24/7 to be encoded by the intended recipient. 

Finally we get to modern day tech with SATCOM, technology that is more commonly known as radars. These radars are incredbily valuable to the military for its reliability and ability to travel long distances. The radars are primarily used to communicate with forces that may be extremly far away from headquarters, but thanks to SATCOM they can communicate and relay important information.


Overall, I would say I did accomplish my goal, in the early stages of the course I wanted to get a better understanding as to how the military communicated with eachother before all of the tools we have at our disposal came to fruition. And that I did, I learned about the communications used in WWI,WWII and the coldwar. I also thouroughly enjoyed doing so, I stated before the world wars have always been super interesting to me but we never covered the communcations much. To learn about telegrams, radios and telephones used in the war was really cool and I'm glad I got to do so.
