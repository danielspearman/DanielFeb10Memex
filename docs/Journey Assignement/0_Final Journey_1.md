In this course, one of the most powerful things i learned about was the importance of storing our information. This journey shows my path in learning about this valuable tool. For starters, in Bush's article, we learn about the begining of the memex, and how he intorduced the idea of storing valuable information in a manner that makes sense. What I mean by that is that Bush envisoned storing our information in an innovative way, not just by date or by subject. But by connecting ideas in a meaningful way that allows for our ideas to grow to their highest potential. This article opened my eyes and showed me just how important the memex could be, at an research level for professionals but also for students looking to organize notes.

My next step in my journey is an idea from my thoughts folder that connects to Bush, Caulfied and Kumar's articles. This idea is short and simple but asks an important question. Why did it take so long? what stopped scientists, researchers and others from developping this idea, why did we wait to organize our ideas meaningfully. Like I said in the note, the digitilization of files certainly helped us in achieving this, however, begs the question if anyone tried to implement this idea without the use of technology.

The third step in my journey is from Caulfield's article, in this article Caulfield talks about his federated wiki. His federated wiki is a place for him to post his thoughts on different things he sees. He often compares it to his twitter but in a more refined and well thought out way. The federated wiki stores all of his thoughts and he can them organize them in a way he finds valuable. To me this sounded eerily similar to a memex, which Caulfield talks about and gives credit to Bush. This article is important because it grows the idea of the memex, it expands on what you can do with a memex, what you can use your memex for. 


The next step in my journey is from a January 11th lecture where I took note of Bush's memex. Specifically, " The way we record info matters". This sentence really stuck with me and had a large impact on my thinking. I think it's because its simple but concise on what it's trying to convey. It's saying that we can take all the notes we want, but at the end of the day if we don't have much care as to how were using these notes, they become invaluable. For me, I've taken notes throughout my academic career, however rarely use them, because I had never learned how to record it with purpose. I never learned about connecting ideas or anything like that, and my notes would then become unused and useless. Understanding the importance of a memex is crucial, and has really helped me make my notes useful and of purpose.

The final step in my journey was Kumar's article, in this article, Kumar talks about how the way we stored books and other pieces in library progressed over time. Once again, its the same idea as Bush and Caulfield, the importance of organizing our information so that it is most helpful to us. In this article it's kind of insane to see just how unorganized we were and how much it hampered our ability to learn. 

My journey from Bush to Kumar demonstrates my learning about what I think has stuck with me most, which is the memex and how much power it has for you if you operate it properly. The idea of the memex is incredibly valuable to me and will be a tool I will be using going forward in my studies.
